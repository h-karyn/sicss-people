I’m here today because I want to apply those skills and strategies that I cultivated so far to the industry I’m truly passionate about, I think it’s not about how you know those strategies and knowledge well, more importantly, it’s about how you collaborate those strategies together and apply them to the real world and real market. I know how to corporate with people, supervisors, and teammates. In project management, I like to collaborate and share information with everyone, listen to them, and Come out with the best plan, everything is about collaboration. There are three steps for me to accomplish, learn and study, learn from the project and tasks, learn from other peers, and be aware of my weaknesses, and strengthen as a self-reflection. participating in the team, communicating with supervisors, and teammates, collaborating with the learning process, and learning from other people. contribute yourself, your power, your knowledge, and your skillsets.

I gained abundant resources and close circumstances relating to clients and customers.
I initially developed my interest in the Computational Social Science because I took a predictive analytics class at U of R, and I was really into the data visualization and applied machine learning we faced and the improvement we can do in the future, I studied and realized more about the sustainability pros for the development. Also, I joined IBM as a consulting intern, I worked in a range of areas from environmental sustainability, to energy and water conservation, green building projects, to sustainable transportation.

Faye-Marie ( Faye) Vassel,"Faye-Marie Vassel is a STEM Equity, and Inclusion Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University in the GSE and HAI. To better elucidate key factors that contribute to pervasive issues of racial-ethnic and gender inequities in undergraduate STEM pathways, Faye-Marie’s postdoctoral research is centered on employing mixed-methods approaches to investigate how undergraduate students from groups historically marginalized in STEM experience and navigate the culture of STEM in post-secondary institutions. Faye-Marie is particularly interested in helping advance the field’s understanding of how students perceive the norms and practices   of the Computational Sciences (CS)  and how this may interact with the CS identity development of students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. With this line of research Faye-Marie aims to contribute to the field's understanding of how the Culture of CS may shape students' decision-making as they pursue Computational Science pathways in the undergraduate context and beyond.  This scholarship is crucial, for there is still much unknown about what social and increasingly shifting political factors may shape equitable post-secondary educational experiences for students from intersectionally marginalized groups in the Computational Sciences (“CS”); students who remain underrepresented and underserved in the Computational Sciences.
